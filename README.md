# Location Identification

In this project, we used deep learning to develop a model that can identify the location of an image with a high degree of accuracy. We used a dataset of images which was formulated by me and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify them. The CNN was able to achieve an accuracy of 81% on the test set, which is a very good result. This project is important because it demonstrates the potential of deep learning for location identification. This task is difficult for traditional methods, but deep learning can learn the patterns in the data and achieve a high degree of accuracy. This technique could be used in many applications, such as mapping, navigation, and search and rescue.
